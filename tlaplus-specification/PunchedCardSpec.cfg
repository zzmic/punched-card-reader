CONSTANTS
    (*
        Finite set of possible data values.
        Currently, only binary data values are introduced to keep the state space manageable for model checking.
    *)
    DataValues = {0, 1}
    (*
        Uncomment (and revise) the following line to expand `DataValues` to support a wider range of values for stress testing.
        Note that this will significantly increase the state space and may impact the feasibility of model checking.
    *)
    \* DataValues = {0, 1, 2}
    (*
        Special value representing no data.
        It is used to indicate the absence of data on a punched card or on the host.
    *)
    NoData = none
    (*
        Maximum number of cards that can be processed.
        It needs to be set to a reasonably small number in order to constrain the state space so that model checking is feasible.
    *)
    MaxNumOfCards = 10
