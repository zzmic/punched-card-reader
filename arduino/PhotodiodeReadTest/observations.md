When the switch is open (IR LED off), the reading is 22–23.

When the switch is closed (IR LED on), the reading is 1018–1019.

When the switch is closed (IR LED on) and a piece of paper (standard letter-
size printer paper folded in half) is inserted between the diodes, the reading 
is 400–500.

The reading drops dramatically when the diodes are moved further apart or 
moved out of alignment. The reading can be tuned by changing the value of the 
resistor attached to the photodiode; a higher resistor value results in 
larger readings. For the reader, we will likely choose a resistor value around 
100 kΩ, though this will need to be tested with the actual reader assembly.
